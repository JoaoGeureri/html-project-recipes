          <h2>About Crepes</h2>
        </header>

        <p>
          Crepes are essentially thin pancakes that are stuffed with sweet
          things like fruit inside. They date back to 13th ce France and the
          myth goes that some woman spilled a bit of porridge on a hot stove
          top. Having done that, she created a very thin pastry which she
          proceeded to eat and enjoy. The rest is history.

          <li>
            In a bowl, whisk together milk, eggs, sugar, salt, and vanilla until
            the mixture gets frothy on the top.
          </li>
          <li>
            Next, grease a small-to-medium-size skillet (8-10 inches) with
            butter set over medium-high heat. Pour ¼ cup of the batter into the
            center of the pan, then immediately lift the pan off the heat and
            tilt it all around until the batter covers the entire bottom of the
            pan.
          </li>
          <li>
            Return the pan to the heat and cook for 30-60 seconds. Use a spatula
            to carefully flip the crepe over and cook for just one minute longer
            on the other side until it’s light brown or golden brown. Remove the
            crepe from the pan and put it on a plate. Cover it to keep it warm
            while you continue the same process with the rest of the batter.
