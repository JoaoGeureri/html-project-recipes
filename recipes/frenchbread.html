        <p>
          It was first developed within the city of Vienna in the 19th century.
          Thanks to the invention of the steam oven at this time, French Bread
          was able to achieve those characteristic features that have made it so
          popular to this day, namely its soft, white interior and its thick,
          hard, brown crust. During the 1920s, it also got its popular form:
          long and round. Why? Well, some labor laws came into place that
          prevented bakers from working long hours so they improvised and
          stretched out their dough in order to achieve fast cook times. As a
          result, its cylinder shape was achieved.
