          <h2>About French Onion Soup</h2>
        </header>

        <p>
          Although this particular kind of soup has existed since Ancient Rome,
          it reached its current state during the 18th century. It is said that,
          after a long, failed hunting trip, Louis XV and his friends came back
          to the country house to look for something to eat. All they found
          within the cupboards was some onions, some champagne, and a bit of
          butter. Since they only had these three ingredients, they decided to
          throw it all into a pot and cook it. Voila, the French onion soup was
          thus born.
